Instructions on getting started:

* Clone the repository:

```git clone git@github.com:yahya-tamur/hydrotag.git```

* Go into the project directory:

```cd hydrotag```

* Copy the `.env.local` file from discord into the project directory. Make sure
  you don't change the name of the file.

*  Run the following commands to install the necessary files and start the app:

```npm install```

```npm run dev```

You should be able to go to `http://localhost:3000` and see the
app.

You only need to run `npm install` if we change dependencies -- you can
usually just run `npm run dev` to start the server.
